# weather-app :computer:

Small weather app that fetches city weather information from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/)'s API.

No frameworks, just plain ol' Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML :zap:

All icons are from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).
Background picture is from [FreePik](https://www.freepik.com/images).

Used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to convert the unix timestamp for sunrise and sunset.
